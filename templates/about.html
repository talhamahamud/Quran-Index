            <p>
              This website was born from a personal journey of reading and
              reflecting on the Qur’an.
            </p>

            <p>
              While studying <i>Tafheem-ul-Qur’an</i> (tafsir by Abul A‘la
              Maududi), I often felt the need to see Qur’anic verses organized
              subject-wise across different surahs. Many themes—such as Jannat,
              about the prophets, guidance, warnings, and mercy etc.—appear
              throughout the Qur’an, but finding them together in one place can
              be difficult for readers.
            </p>
            <div style="height: 16px"></div>
            <p>From this need, the idea for this project came to my mind.</p>
            <div style="height: 16px"></div>
            <p>
              I began carefully listing Qur’anic ayat by subject, while also
              keeping them connected to their respective surahs, so that readers
              can navigate easily and reflect more deeply on each topic. This
              project is meant to help students, researchers, and general
              readers engage with the Qur’an in a more structured and meaningful
              way.

              This is a continuous and evolving effort, and I am fully aware

              My intention is simple: To serve the Qur’an, to make its study
              easier, and to help others reflect upon its guidance.

## About This Project

This website was born from a personal journey of reading and reflecting on the Qur’an.

While studying **Tafheem-ul-Qur’an** (tafsir by Abul A‘la Maududi), I often felt the need to view Qur’anic verses arranged **subject-wise across different surahs**. Many themes—such as **Jannah, stories of the prophets, guidance, warnings, mercy**, and others—reappear throughout the Qur’an, but locating them collectively can be challenging.

From this need, the idea for this project emerged.

I began carefully listing Qur’anic ayat by subject while preserving their connection to their surahs. This allows readers to navigate effortlessly and reflect more deeply on each topic. This platform aims to support:

* Students
* Researchers
* General readers

in studying the Qur’an in a clearer, more organized manner.
